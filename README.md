## Hello!

I'm Christelinda. I am a grad student at Mount Allison University, pursuing a MSc. in Biology. My main interests include neurophysiology, R-coding and data visualization.

I wrote an R package called **patchclampplotteR**, which allows electrophysiologists to create publication-quality plots from raw patch clamp recording data. You can learn more on [the patchclampplotteR website](https://christelinda-laureijs.github.io/patchclampplotteR/index.html)!

For my honours thesis ([https://github.com/christelinda-laureijs/honours-thesis](https://github.com/christelinda-laureijs/honours-thesis)), I examined the effect of insulin on neurons in the DMH (short for *dorsomedial hypothalamus*). This brain region helps to regulate appetite and body weight, as well as many other physiological processes. I developed R scripts to plot and analyze raw data from electrophysiological recordings. I also created an RMarkdown template and LaTeX preamble for my thesis to match university formatting requirements.

I built a personal website using R, blogdown, and Netlify to highlight my professional projects. This can be found at [https://christelindalaureijs.com/](https://christelindalaureijs.com/)!
