## Hello!

I'm Christelinda. I am a grad student at Mount Allison University, pursuing a MSc. in Biology. My main interests include neurophysiology, R-coding and data visualization.

## Recent projects

For my honours thesis ([https://github.com/christelinda-laureijs/honours-thesis](https://github.com/christelinda-laureijs/honours-thesis)), I examined the effect of insulin on neurons in the DMH (short for *dorsomedial hypothalamus*). This brain region helps to regulate appetite and body weight, as well as many other physiological processes. I developed R scripts to plot and analyze raw data from electrophysiological recordings. I also created an RMarkdown template and LaTeX preamble for my thesis to match university formatting requirements.

I am working on coding a personal website to highlight my professional projects. This project is still in development!
